\title{Example BCFM Results}
\format{
A list with two components:
\describe{
\item{Result}{A list containing the MCMC samples and fitted model components:
B (loading matrix), mu (cluster means), X (factor scores), Z (cluster assignments),
probs (cluster probabilities), sigma (error variances), tau (factor variances),
and omega (within-cluster covariances)}
\item{order}{Variable ordering used in the model}
}
}
\source{
Generated using the BCFM package on simulated data
}
\usage{
SDresult
}
\description{
Pre-computed results from fitting a BCFM model with 4 groups and 4 factors
on the simulated dataset. These results are used in the package vignette
to demonstrate visualization and interpretation.
}
\details{
This object was created by running BCFM.model.selection with 4 groups and 4 factors
on the simulated data for 10,000 MCMC iterations with 5,000 burnin.
